title: My journey so far
---

(WIP)

#### Motivation
Why write in my own blog
* document my journey to share with the world, find people who relate, and feel less alone
* faster way to recall what I have gone through vs poring through 7+ years of journal entries
* remind myself that it's all adding up and heading somewhere

#### My journey so far
SGV - with enough persistence, I can break down daunting complex formulae; I can be happy doing anything
Smart - the most impactful solution is the simplest and most understandable; seeking to focus by subtracting things out of your life is sometimes not the best decision (does not free time for more important things but reduces the richness of life’s experiences)
ThinkingMachines - 
Everything is possible to people who dream - taking part in shaping a company’s culture, open source as a business
merit (self-worth) cannot be achieved through association - 6mos passed and never felt I deserved to buy a new laptop
it's okay to be selfish - 1-1’s talking openly about possible futures outside the company

#### Content
Business knowledge that might provide value in the future
Personal rationalizations to make meaning from my experiences
Concrete events that happened to me that led me to think this way

#### Goals
Be a better, kinder, more dignified person - I am not less of a person just because I spend 2 years at most at a job
Don’t repeat the same mistakes
Move forward in my path
