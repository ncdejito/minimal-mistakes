(WIP)

#### Goals
1. Quick encyclopedia-like index page for widening robotics knowledge

#### Outline
Preview
Configuration Space - a specification of the positions of all points of the robot
Rigid-Body Motions
Forward Kinematics
Velocity Kinematics and Statics - statics - analysis of loads acting on physical systems that do not experience an acceleration
Inverse Kinematics
Kinematics of Closed Chains - Any kinematic chain that contains one or more loops,  focused on parallel mechanisms (consisting of fixed and moving platforms connected by a set of “legs”)
Dynamics of Open Chains - study of motion taking into account forces and torques that cause them
Trajectory Generation - robot position as a function of time, time scaling (specifies the time when those configurations are reached)
Motion Planning - problem of finding a robot motion from a start state to a goal state that avoids obstacles in the environment and satisfies other constraints, such as joint limits or torque limits
Robot Control - motion control, force control, hybrid motion-force control, or impedance control
Grasping and Manipulation - contact kinematics; contact force modelling; and the dynamics of rigid bodies
Wheeled Mobile Robots - kinematic model of a mobile robot governs how wheel speeds map to robot velocities
